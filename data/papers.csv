A technique that could add a reference citation at the appropriate place in a sentence will be beneficial. In this perspective, the context-aware citation recommendation has been researched for around two decades. Many researchers have utilized the text data called the context sentence, which surrounds the citation tag, and the metadata of the target paper to find the appropriate cited research. However, the lack of well-organized benchmarking datasets, and no model that can attain high performance has made the research difficult. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based model and well-organized dataset for context-aware paper citation recommendation. Our model comprises a document encoder and a context encoder. For this, we use graph convolutional networks layer, and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, a pre-trained model of textual data. By modifying the related PeerRead dataset, we propose a new dataset called FullTextPeerRead containing context sentences to cited references and paper metadata. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first well-organized dataset for a context-aware paper recommendation. The results indicate that the proposed model with the proposed datasets can attain state-of-the-art performance and achieve a more than 28% improvement in mean average precision and recall@k."

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based model and well-organized dataset for context-aware paper citation recommendation. Our model comprises a document encoder and a context encoder. For this, we use graph convolutional networks layer, and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, a pre-trained model of textual data. By modifying the related PeerRead dataset, we propose a new dataset called FullTextPeerRead containing context sentences to cited references and paper metadata. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first well-organized dataset for a context-aware paper recommendation. The results indicate that the proposed model with the proposed datasets can attain state-of-the-art performance and achieve a more than 28% improvement in mean average precision and recall@k."

Many researchers have utilized the text data called the context sentence, which surrounds the citation tag, and the metadata of the target paper to find the appropriate cited research. However, the lack of well-organized benchmarking datasets, and no model that can attain high performance has made the research difficult. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based model and well-organized dataset for context-aware paper citation recommendation. Our model comprises a document encoder and a context encoder. For this, we use graph convolutional networks layer, and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, a pre-trained model of textual data. By modifying the related PeerRead dataset, we propose a new dataset called FullTextPeerRead containing context sentences to cited references and paper metadata. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first well-organized dataset for a context-aware paper recommendation.

Many researchers have utilized the text data called the context sentence, which surrounds the citation tag, and the metadata of the target paper to find the appropriate cited research. However, the lack of well-organized benchmarking datasets, and no model that can attain high performance has made the research difficult. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based model and well-organized dataset for context-aware paper citation recommendation. Our model comprises a document encoder and a context encoder. For this, we use graph convolutional networks layer, and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, a pre-trained model of textual data. By modifying the related PeerRead dataset, we propose a new dataset called FullTextPeerRead containing context sentences to cited references and paper metadata. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first well-organized dataset for a context-aware paper recommendation.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based model and well-organized dataset for context-aware paper citation recommendation. Our model comprises a document encoder and a context encoder. For this, we use graph convolutional networks layer, and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, a pre-trained model of textual data. By modifying the related PeerRead dataset, we propose a new dataset called FullTextPeerRead containing context sentences to cited references and paper metadata. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first well-organized dataset for a context-aware paper recommendation. The results indicate that the proposed model with the proposed datasets can attain state-of-the-art performance and achieve a more than 28% improvement in mean average precision and recall@k."

Many researchers have utilized the text data called the context sentence, which surrounds the citation tag, and the metadata of the target paper to find the appropriate cited research. However, the lack of well-organized benchmarking datasets, and no model that can attain high performance has made the research difficult. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based model and well-organized dataset for context-aware paper citation recommendation. Our model comprises a document encoder and a context encoder. For this, we use graph convolutional networks layer, and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, a pre-trained model of textual data.

Context-aware citation recommendation aims to overcome this problem by providing a list of scientific papers given a short passage of text. In this paper, we propose a long–short-term memory (LSTM)-based model for context-aware citation recommendation, which first learns the distributed representations of the citation contexts and the scientific papers separately based on LSTM, and then measures the relevance based on the learned distributed representation of citation contexts and the scientific papers. Finally, the scientific papers with high relevance scores are selected as the recommendation list. In particular, we try to incorporate author information, venue information, and content information in scientific paper distributed vector representation. Furthermore, we integrate author information of the given context in citation context distributed vector representation. Thus, the proposed model makes personalized context-aware citation recommendation possible, which is a new issue that few papers addressed in the past. When conducting experiments on the ACL Anthology Network and DBLP data sets, the results demonstrate the proposed LSTM-based model for context-aware citation recommendation is able to achieve considerable improvement over previous context-aware citation recommendation approaches. The personalized recommendation approach is also competitive with the non-personalized recommendation approach."

Finally, the scientific papers with high relevance scores are selected as the recommendation list. In particular, we try to incorporate author information, venue information, and content information in scientific paper distributed vector representation. Furthermore, we integrate author information of the given context in citation context distributed vector representation. Thus, the proposed model makes personalized context-aware citation recommendation possible, which is a new issue that few papers addressed in the past. When conducting experiments on the ACL Anthology Network and DBLP data sets, the results demonstrate the proposed LSTM-based model for context-aware citation recommendation is able to achieve considerable improvement over previous context-aware citation recommendation approaches. The personalized recommendation approach is also competitive with the non-personalized recommendation approach."

In particular, we try to incorporate author information, venue information, and content information in scientific paper distributed vector representation. Furthermore, we integrate author information of the given context in citation context distributed vector representation. Thus, the proposed model makes personalized context-aware citation recommendation possible, which is a new issue that few papers addressed in the past. When conducting experiments on the ACL Anthology Network and DBLP data sets, the results demonstrate the proposed LSTM-based model for context-aware citation recommendation is able to achieve considerable improvement over previous context-aware citation recommendation approaches. The personalized recommendation approach is also competitive with the non-personalized recommendation approach."

We describe the data collection process and report interesting observed phenomena in the peer reviews. We also propose two novel NLP tasks based on this dataset and provide simple baseline models. In the first task, we show that simple models can predict whether a paper is accepted with up to 21% error reduction compared to the majority baseline. In the second task, we predict the numerical scores of review aspects and show that simple models can outperform the mean baseline for aspects with high variance such as ‘originality’ and ‘impact’."

This article extends previous study of quote recommendation, the task that recommends the appropriate quote according to the context (i.e., the content occurring before and after the quote). In this article, a quote recommender system called QuoteRec is presented to tackle the task. We investigate two models to learn the vector representations of quotes and contexts, and then rank the candidate quotes based on the representations. The first model learns the quote representation according to the contexts of a quote. The second model is an extension of the neural network model in previous study, which learns the representation of a quote by concerning both its content and contexts.

However, there are times when we are eager to stress our idea by citing a quote, while nothing relevant comes to mind. Therefore, it is exciting to have a recommender system which provides quote recommendations while we are writing. This article extends previous study of quote recommendation, the task that recommends the appropriate quote according to the context (i.e., the content occurring before and after the quote). In this article, a quote recommender system called QuoteRec is presented to tackle the task. We investigate two models to learn the vector representations of quotes and contexts, and then rank the candidate quotes based on the representations. The first model learns the quote representation according to the contexts of a quote.

An appropriate usage of quote usually equips the expression with more elegance and credibility. However, there are times when we are eager to stress our idea by citing a quote, while nothing relevant comes to mind. Therefore, it is exciting to have a recommender system which provides quote recommendations while we are writing. This article extends previous study of quote recommendation, the task that recommends the appropriate quote according to the context (i.e., the content occurring before and after the quote). In this article, a quote recommender system called QuoteRec is presented to tackle the task. We investigate two models to learn the vector representations of quotes and contexts, and then rank the candidate quotes based on the representations. The first model learns the quote representation according to the contexts of a quote. The second model is an extension of the neural network model in previous study, which learns the representation of a quote by concerning both its content and contexts.

Context-aware citation recommendation aims to solve this problem by providing a curated list of high-quality candidates given a short passage of text. Existing literature adopts bag-of-word representations leading to the loss of valuable semantics and lacks the ability to integrate metadata or generalize to unseen manuscripts in the training set. We propose a flexible encoder-decoder architecture called Neural Citation Network (NCN), embodying a robust representation of the citation context with a max time delay neural network, further augmented with an attention mechanism and author networks. The recurrent neural network decoder consults this representation when determining the optimal paper to recommend based solely on its title. Quantitative results on the large-scale CiteSeer dataset reveal NCN cultivates a significant improvement over competitive baselines. Qualitative evidence highlights the effectiveness of the proposed end-to-end neural network revealing a promising research direction for citation recommendation."

In order to identify shared interests, behavior-based methods consider similar browsing or search patterns of users, whereas content-based methods use information from the contents of the documents visited by the users. So far, content-based user clustering has mostly focused on static sets of relatively long documents. Given the dynamic nature of social media, there is a need to dynamically cluster users in the context of streams of short texts. User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past. The clustering results are explainable and human-understandable, in contrast to many other clustering algorithms.

UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past. The clustering results are explainable and human-understandable, in contrast to many other clustering algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we work with a dataset consisting of users and tweets from each user. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed short-term and long-term dependency user clustering models compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past. The clustering results are explainable and human-understandable, in contrast to many other clustering algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we work with a dataset consisting of users and tweets from each user. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed short-term and long-term dependency user clustering models compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

Given the dynamic nature of social media, there is a need to dynamically cluster users in the context of streams of short texts. User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past. The clustering results are explainable and human-understandable, in contrast to many other clustering algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we work with a dataset consisting of users and tweets from each user. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed short-term and long-term dependency user clustering models compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past. The clustering results are explainable and human-understandable, in contrast to many other clustering algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we work with a dataset consisting of users and tweets from each user. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed short-term and long-term dependency user clustering models compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

So far, content-based user clustering has mostly focused on static sets of relatively long documents.

User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past.

In order to identify shared interests, behavior-based methods consider similar browsing or search patterns of users, whereas content-based methods use information from the contents of the documents visited by the users. So far, content-based user clustering has mostly focused on static sets of relatively long documents. Given the dynamic nature of social media, there is a need to dynamically cluster users in the context of streams of short texts. User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past. The clustering results are explainable and human-understandable, in contrast to many other clustering algorithms.

In order to identify shared interests, behavior-based methods consider similar browsing or search patterns of users, whereas content-based methods use information from the contents of the documents visited by the users. So far, content-based user clustering has mostly focused on static sets of relatively long documents. Given the dynamic nature of social media, there is a need to dynamically cluster users in the context of streams of short texts. User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past. The clustering results are explainable and human-understandable, in contrast to many other clustering algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we work with a dataset consisting of users and tweets from each user.

User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past. The clustering results are explainable and human-understandable, in contrast to many other clustering algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we work with a dataset consisting of users and tweets from each user. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed short-term and long-term dependency user clustering models compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

In order to identify shared interests, behavior-based methods consider similar browsing or search patterns of users, whereas content-based methods use information from the contents of the documents visited by the users. So far, content-based user clustering has mostly focused on static sets of relatively long documents. Given the dynamic nature of social media, there is a need to dynamically cluster users in the context of streams of short texts. User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past.

Given the dynamic nature of social media, there is a need to dynamically cluster users in the context of streams of short texts. User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past. The clustering results are explainable and human-understandable, in contrast to many other clustering algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we work with a dataset consisting of users and tweets from each user. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed short-term and long-term dependency user clustering models compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

In order to identify shared interests, behavior-based methods consider similar browsing or search patterns of users, whereas content-based methods use information from the contents of the documents visited by the users. So far, content-based user clustering has mostly focused on static sets of relatively long documents. Given the dynamic nature of social media, there is a need to dynamically cluster users in the context of streams of short texts. User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past.

User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents, as it is difficult to capture the users’ dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (UCT). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user’s time-varying topic distributions based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on previously estimated distributions. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. UCT can be used in two ways: (1) as a short-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distribution based on the user’s topic distributions during the previous time period only, and (2) as a long-term dependency model that infers a user’s current topic distributions based on the user’s topic distributions during multiple time periods in the past. The clustering results are explainable and human-understandable, in contrast to many other clustering algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we work with a dataset consisting of users and tweets from each user. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed short-term and long-term dependency user clustering models compared to state-of-the-art baselines."
