913f54b44dfb9202955fe296cf5586e1105565ea,A context-aware citation recommendation model with BERT and graph convolutional networks,2019,"With the tremendous growth in the number of scientific papers being published, searching for references while writing a scientific paper is a time-consuming process. A technique that could add a reference citation at the appropriate place in a sentence will be beneficial. In this perspective, the context-aware citation recommendation has been researched for around two decades. Many researchers have utilized the text data called the context sentence, which surrounds the citation tag, and the metadata of the target paper to find the appropriate cited research. However, the lack of well-organized benchmarking datasets, and no model that can attain high performance has made the research difficult. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based model and well-organized dataset for context-aware paper citation recommendation. Our model comprises a document encoder and a context encoder. For this, we use graph convolutional networks layer, and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, a pre-trained model of textual data. By modifying the related PeerRead dataset, we propose a new dataset called FullTextPeerRead containing context sentences to cited references and paper metadata. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first well-organized dataset for a context-aware paper recommendation. The results indicate that the proposed model with the proposed datasets can attain state-of-the-art performance and achieve a more than 28% improvement in mean average precision and recall@k.",

Context-aware citation recommendation aims to overcome this problem by providing a list of scientific papers given a short passage of text. In this paper, we propose a long–short-term memory (LSTM)-based model for context-aware citation recommendation, which first learns the distributed representations of the citation contexts and the scientific papers separately based on LSTM, and then measures the relevance based on the learned distributed representation of citation contexts and the scientific papers. Finally, the scientific papers with high relevance scores are selected as the recommendation list. In particular, we try to incorporate author information, venue information, and content information in scientific paper distributed vector representation. Furthermore, we integrate author information of the given context in citation context distributed vector representation. Thus, the proposed model makes personalized context-aware citation recommendation possible, which is a new issue that few papers addressed in the past. When conducting experiments on the ACL Anthology Network and DBLP data sets, the results demonstrate the proposed LSTM-based model for context-aware citation recommendation is able to achieve considerable improvement over previous context-aware citation recommendation approaches. The personalized recommendation approach is also competitive with the non-personalized recommendation approach.",

We present the first public dataset of scientific peer reviews available for research purposes (PeerRead v1),1 providing an opportunity to study this important artifact. The dataset consists of 14.7K paper drafts and the corresponding accept/reject decisions in top-tier venues including ACL, NIPS and ICLR. The dataset also includes 10.7K textual peer reviews written by experts for a subset of the papers. We describe the data collection process and report interesting observed phenomena in the peer reviews. We also propose two novel NLP tasks based on this dataset and provide simple baseline models. In the first task, we show that simple models can predict whether a paper is accepted with up to 21% error reduction compared to the majority baseline. In the second task, we predict the numerical scores of review aspects and show that simple models can outperform the mean baseline for aspects with high variance such as ‘originality’ and ‘impact’.",
